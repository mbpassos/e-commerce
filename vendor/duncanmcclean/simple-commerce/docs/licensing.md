Simple Commerce is a paid Statamic Addon. It's not my full time job but I still spend a considerable amount of time working on it, so some kind of payment is only fair.

Like Statamic itself, using Simple Commerce is free during development & staging environments ([refer to the docs](https://statamic.dev/licensing#public-domains)). You only need to purchase a license when you go live.

## Assigning a license to a site

I've recorded a quick screencast showing how you can assign a Simple Commerce liense to a site on [statamic.com](https://statamic.com) ðŸ”½

TLDR of it is:

1. Buy a license on the Statamic Marketplace
2. Create a site on [statamic.com](https://statamic.com)
3. Go to edit the site & assign the license to the site
4. In your project's `.env` file, set the license key to the value displayed on Statamic.com

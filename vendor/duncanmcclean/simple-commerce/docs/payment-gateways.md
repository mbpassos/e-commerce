title: Payment Gateways

Out of the box, Simple Commerce integrates with a few of the popular payment gateway options to make it easy to get up & running. If you need to use a gateway that's not on the list, you'll likely need to [build it yourself](/payment-gateways/custom-gateways).

Whilst in development, you may use the [Dummy Gateway](/payment-gateways/dummy) provided by SC which allows you to enter card details for testing which will always be accepted. It's intended for being easy to use in demos.
